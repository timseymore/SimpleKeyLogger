* To change the path:
  * open *path.txt* and change the string to represent the new path
  * the new path must have the file *log.txt* (or whatever you choose for a file name) present in order for the system to run properly

#### Running the key logger:
To **run** the key logger double click *keylogger.pyw* 

The key logger will now be running in the background.

To **terminate** the key logger, open the *Task Manager* and end all processes named *Python*.

#### Using the analysis tool:

You may double-click or open *analysisTool.py* from the command line to open the program in a console window.

Here you can view the log file and search by date or by pattern, among other options.
